          Our everyday life depends on reliable and affordable energy. Yet
          energy is the contributing factor to climate change, accounting for 60
          percent of total global greenhouse gas emissions.
        </p>
        <p class="text-container">
          The United Nations has established a goal of Ensuring universal access
          to affordable electricity by 2030, emphasising that to reach the goal
          requires investing in sustainable global energy.
        </p>
        <p class="text-container">
          The following data visualisation explores possible contributing
          factors of global energy and establishes a possible conclusion based
          on the factors and recommends a reasonable solution to allowing
          universal access to clean and affordable energy.

          The following bubble plot explores if there is a link between GDP per
          capita and CO2 emission of a country. Each bubble represents a country
          and 6 different continents represent a variety of spreadness on the
          chart. Furthermore, a size channel is used to present relationships
          between the energy consumption per capita and CO2 emission.
        </p>
        <p class="parallel-paragraphs">
          It is apparent that China is the highest carbon dioxide producer
          despite low GDP per capita. There is not a huge relationship between
          GDP per capita and CO2 emissions as huge CO2 emitted countries still
          have low GDP per capita. By continent, European countries are
          wealthiest based on the scattered dataplot when compared and emitted
          more CO2 than other continents.
        </p>
        <p class="parallel-paragraphs">
          This is not a huge surprise as developed countries have skyscrapers
          and many other utilised facilities and Europe has most of them . In
          energy consumption, it is a surprise that Europe and Asian countries
          tend to have huge consumption while African countries are low energy
          users. Click on the Year selection and choose from 2000 to 2019 to
          further explore the relationship.

        The cholorpleth map show the percentage of countries getting access to
        electricity . An interactive slider is provided to express how the
        continuous data is expressed for each country. This data set is more
        important for the developing countries because getting access to
        electricity also means those countries will use other alternatives such
        as fuel and coal for cooking. This does not also produce pollution to
        the society but also raise a lot of health issues , such as lung cancer
        and staff. According to news ABC, 90 percent of people has died from
        using coal, and this is evidented by some other data research.

          Globally, the production of renewable energy is increasing as well so
          don’t worry too much about CO2 emission over the years. I am not
          saying CO2 emission can be compensated but at least don’t think in a
          bad way. The stacked area chart expresses global renewable energy
          production from 1980 to 2020, which is increasing over the time. The
          hydro generation takes up majority of the production and still
          increasing. Wind energy has started to increase from 2005 and is
          increasing over the year. Minor energy production goes to geo biomass
          production. This is because biomass energy requires arable land to
          develop.This means that land used for biofuel crops such as corn and
          soybeans are unavailable to grow food or provide natural habitats.
          Therefore, if forested areas are not sustainably cut, re-planted, and
          given time to grow and sequester carbon, the advantages of using the
          wood for fuel are not offset by the trees’ regrowth.

            and India and Russia. The cholorpleth map show the percentage of
            countries getting access to electricity . An interactive slider is

            According to news ABC, 90 percent of people has died from using
            coal, and this is evidented by some other data research. From this
            article, it is concluded that GDP has no huge dominance over the CO2
            emission of a country. From the world map, it is evident that all
            the countries need access to electricity and the trend also explains
            that the world is increasing production of renewable energy and the
            proportion is taking over the place. If this current rate of energy
            production is going, the estimated result is that the united nations
            goal is reached and this is the final conclusion. %I need to
